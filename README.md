**The Mathematical Game of NIM**
================================

Nim is a mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns removing objects from distinct heaps. On each turn, a player must remove at least one object, and may remove any number of objects provided they all come from the same heap. Nim can be played as a misere game, in which the player to take the last object loses. Nim can also be played as a normal play game, which means that the person who takes the last object wins.
